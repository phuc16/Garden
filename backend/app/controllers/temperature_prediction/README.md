# Temperature prediction

### Goal:
Predict:
* valve level of radiator in next 15 minutes,
* temperature measured by sensor in next 15 minutes. 

### Data: 
Provided by a lecturer. Data collected in an office. Contains:
* temperature measured by 3 different sensors,
* valve level of radiator,
* set temperature in a room. 

### Assumptions:
* People stay in a room only during working hours in business days.
* Temperature sensors are located in different distance from radiator.

### Results: 
MAE of predictions: 
* measured temperature ~ 0.07 Â°C
* valve level ~ 8.5 %
